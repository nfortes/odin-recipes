            <li>Add the turmeric powder to the rice, stir until the colour is even, and leave it to cook in a rice cooker.</li>
            <li>Shape the rice into little balls for the ears, head, hands, and body according to the diagram above,
                and arrange them on the bed of lettuce leaves - apart from the hands which will be placed later. You can
                tear the lettuce up into smaller pieces if you wish.</li>

            <li>Beat the eggs with the milk until well-mixed.</li>
            <li>Melt butter on a pan on high heat and spread it around. Pour the egg mixture in and swirl for 20 seconds before
                reducing the heat to a medium setting.</li>
            <li>When the egg becomes viscous enough on the surface, slide it over Pompompurin's body like a blanket, with the
                help of a spatula. Fold the edge that's closest to Pompompurin's face 1cm down.</li>
            <li>Heat up the white sauce in a pot using medium heat, and pour over the omelette with a spoon.</li>

            <li>Cut the mushroom in half, and cut the other vegetables into the shape of flowers. It will help if you have a
                vegetable-cutting mold. Cook all the veggies in the microwave for 40 seconds at 600W.</li>
            <li>Place the mushroom on Pompompurin's head as a hat, and jazz up the blanket with the other vegetables. Arrange
                his hands on top of the blanket and decorate the empty space on the omelette between his hands using the ketchup.</li>
            <li>Draw Pompompurin's sleeping face using the chocolate pen. If you don't have a chocolate pen, you can always use
                chocolate sauce and a toothpick.</li>
