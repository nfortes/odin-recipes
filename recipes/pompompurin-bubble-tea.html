        <h2>Recipe</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>   
            <li>1/2 c mango (fresh or frozen)</li>
            <li>1 tsp honey</li>
            <li>1/2 c milk</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp tapioca pearls (boba)</li>
            <li>Milk chocolate melting chocolates</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Let's start by piping Pompompurin's face on the glass! Melt down a few of your melting chocolates in a microwave safe bowl 
                for approximately 2 minutes, stopping every 30 seconds to stir.  Next, scoop your melted chocolate into a piping bag with 
                tip trim about 1/8 of an inch.  Grab your glass and begin by piping Pompompurin's hat about a 1/4 of the way down. Moving 
                down to to the middle of the glass, pipe two small circular eyes. Finish his face with a cute little smile and nose just 
                below his eyes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Now let's move onto the delicious bubble tea!  Start by cooking your tapioca pearls.  Bring 4 cups of water to a boil and 
                slowly add your tapioca pearls.  When the tapioca pearls float to the top of the water, cover the pot and let simmer for 
                2-3 minutes.  Next, remove the tapioca pearls and place in cool water for about 5 minutes.  Once cooled, pour into your 
                Pompompurin glass!</li>
            <li>Now we're ready for the mango milk!  Put your mango, honey, and milk into a blender. Blend ingredients until completely 
                smooth. Next pour into your Pompompurin glass and add ice if desired. Enjoy your refreshing drink!</li>
